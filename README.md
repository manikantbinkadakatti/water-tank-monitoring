# Water Tank Monitoring System ðŸš°

## Overview
An IoT system to monitor real-time water levels in industrial tanks using ESP32 microcontrollers and ultrasonic sensors, communicating over RS485 and visualized through a Node-RED dashboard.

## Features
- Real-time water level display
- Reliable RS485 long-distance communication
- Node-RED dashboard with visual gauge
- Alarm system for low/high water levels

## Technologies Used
- RS485 Modbus Communication
- Node-RED (Dashboard)
- MQTT (optional)
- Ultrasonic Sensors

## How to Use
1. Setup RS485 A/B communication lines between Master and Node-RED server.
2. Deploy the Node-RED dashboard flow (provided).
3. Monitor water level percentage in real-time.

## Future Improvements
- Mobile app integration
- Predictive maintenance analytics
